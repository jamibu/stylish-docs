# Markdown to HTML <!-- omit in toc --> 
This app is made to convert Markdown files to HTML in the style of Github's READMEs. To do this, a Github Flavoured Markdown compiler is called (the same used by Github) and CSS is applied to mirror the style of Github docs. This also support the Table of Content generated by VS Code.

## Table of Contents <!-- omit in toc -->
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Running from the to_convert folder](#running-from-the-to_convert-folder)
- [Running manually](#running-manually)
- [A note on images](#a-note-on-images)
- [HTML templates](#html-templates)

## Installation
To run this you will need docker installed and running. This is because the markdown compiler this app uses cannot be run in Windows at the moment. To install the app you simply need to run.
```
./install.bat
```

## Running from the to_convert folder
You can automatically convert one or more Markdown files by placing then in the "to_convert" folder and running from the .bat file. The converted files will be written to the "to_convert" folder under the same name as the original file.
```
./run.bat
```

## Running manually
The scripts can also be directly called on any given markdown file as follows
```
python ./src/markdown_to_html.py README.md
```
The following options are also available when running the scipt:
* ```--template```: Path to a Jinja HTML template file that will define the HTML that wraps around the converted markdown
* ```--markdown_api```: URL for API method used to convert markdown to HTML
* ```--title```: Title that will be displayed in the browser tab

Below is an example of the python script being run directly with all optional inputs set manually. The values used in this example are the default values. You can change any of these as you wish. 

```
python ./src/markdown_to_html.py README.md ^ 
--template template.html ^
--markdown_api http://localhost:8888/to_styled_html ^
--title README
```

When running in this manner the output HTML file will be written in the same directory as the markdown file.

## A note on images
If you add images (or other static files) in your Markdown file using relative paths you will need to be careful to maintain the relative location of the file to the HTML file (e.g. by having the HTML file in the same folder as the Mardown file)

## HTML templates
This app lays out the HTML files based on [Jinja Templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). Note that this only defines the HTML around the converted markdown which is added as one big blob. Below we can see the default template which is a very simple example of such a template.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>{{ title }}</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-markdown-css/5.1.0/github-markdown.css" integrity="sha512-Av8h36R+zgh5kcdZXursq5ZiKVOEQ/K/M4lZcFsbPJMKfrRaUXatxZERx2s6LzAfVUcWg90Yycl4Gsfdgfd29A==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
<style>
	.markdown-body {
		box-sizing: border-box;
		min-width: 200px;
		max-width: 980px;
		margin: 0 auto;
		padding: 45px;
	}

	@media (max-width: 767px) {
		.markdown-body {
			padding: 15px;
		}
	}
</style>

<body class="markdown-body">
{{ markdown }}
</body>
```
All this does is add our markdown in the body of the file, set some styling to make the HTML the same as Github docs, and set the title.
